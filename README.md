Hs264 is (going to be) a H.264 decoder in Haskell.

If you want to study the code, I suggest you grab a copy of the H.264 standard first: http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.264

DISCLAIMER: The main purpose of this project is to provide me with the necessary motivation for mastering Haskell and the funcional programming paradigm. Since I'm fairly novice in both, don't expect to find academic coding style and elegant solutions. Comments of any kind are warmly welcome though.
